				<p>My name is Tony Green. I am a self taught developer with plenty of general work experience. Over my years in the work force I have aquired a classic work ethic, learned to be a part of a team as well as be a leader, and even to work independently.</p>

				<p>I enjoy being challenged and learning new things.</p>
